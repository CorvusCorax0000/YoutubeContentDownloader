This is a simple Python program to download multiple video/audio files at once from a YouTube playlist using YouTube Data API.
The code can be modified to just download video/audio files without the need to provide a whole playlist.

This program is made for educational purposes. Please use downloaded content for personal use, offline viewing or academic references only.
Going against the terms of service of YouTube is inadvisable.
